# scattr üé®

**Generate visually rich layouts in seconds**

scattr is a smart asset layout generator that creates beautiful, naturally-distributed layouts from your images. Perfect for creating collages, mood boards, wallpapers, and artistic compositions with professional-looking spacing and arrangement.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart layout generation** - Creates natural, organic spacing using advanced algorithms
- **Flexible customization** - Control spacing, density, rotation, and scaling
- **Rich backgrounds** - Solid colors, gradients, custom images, or transparent
- **High-quality export** - Save your layouts as PNG / JPG at any resolution



## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

scattr implements **Bridson's Fast Poisson Disk Sampling algorithm** to create natural-looking layouts:

1. **Spatial grid optimization** - Uses a background grid for fast neighbor lookups
2. **Active sample management** - Maintains a list of potential placement points  
3. **Collision detection** - Ensures minimum spacing requirements are met
4. **Rejection sampling** - Tries multiple candidate positions to find valid placements

This approach creates organic, non-uniform distributions that look natural while being mathematically sound - no overlapping assets, no awkward clustering, just beautiful spacing every time.



## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Layout Parameters
- **Item Spacing**: Controls spacing between assets (10-200px)
- **Fill Density**: How densely packed your layout should be (Sparse to Dense)
- **Asset Size**: Global scaling factor for all assets (Tiny to Huge)

### Visual Effects
- **Random Rotation**: Enable/disable with custom angle ranges (-180¬∞ to 180¬∞)
- **Random Scale**: Variable sizing with min/max scale factors (0.1x to 5.0x)
- **Unique Assets Only**: Prevent duplicate asset placement

### Background Options
- **Solid Colors**: Advanced color picker with hex input
- **Gradients**: Multi-stop gradients with drag-and-drop editing
- **Images**: Upload custom background images
- **Transparency**: Export with transparent backgrounds
